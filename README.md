# Rush Hour

This is the GitHub repository for my digital humanities project, The Body of Chicago, a visual essay examining the relationship between the neighborhoods of Chicago and its public transportation system. I know it's a strange title, but while looking at the data that the CTA provides for its services, the graph of the daily ridership at the Fullerton L station looked very similar to a heartbeat on an EKG. I started envisioning the neighborhoods as the organs making up Chicago and the CTA as veins and arteries servicing these organs.

This project will be a website, designed to emulate the visual essays published by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool). I wanted to build something with the same effect as a project on their website, something technically impressive and also centered around a relevant and interesting (to me at least) topic. 

I'm currently working with Tableau Desktop, D3, and GitHub Pages to build the website. Stay tuned for updates and the final version, to be prototyped by April 25th.
